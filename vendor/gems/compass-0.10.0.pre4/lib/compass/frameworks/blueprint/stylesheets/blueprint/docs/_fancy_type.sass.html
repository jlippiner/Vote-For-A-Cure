Mixin: fancy-type()
--------------------
To install the fancy type plugin:
  1. import the fancy_type module: @import blueprint/fancy_type
  2. mixin +fancy-type to your project's body or at the top level of your stylesheet:
    body
      +fancy-type

Mixin: sibling-indentation()
-----------------------------
Indentation instead of line shifts for sibling paragraphs. Mixin to a style like p + p

Mixin: alt()
-------------
For great looking type, use this code instead of asdf: 
<span class="alt">asdf</span>  
Best used on prepositions and ampersands.

Mixin: dquo(!offset)
--------------
For great looking quote marks in titles, replace "asdf" with:
<span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>asdf&#8221;
(That is, when the title starts with a quote mark). 
(You may have to change this value depending on your font size).

Mixin: incr(!font_size)
--------------
Reduced size type with incremental leading
(http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/incremental_leading/)

This could be used for side notes. For smaller type, you don't necessarily want to 
follow the 1.5x vertical rhythm -- the line-height is too much. 

Using this mixin, reduces your font size and line-height so that for 
every four lines of normal sized type, there is five lines of the sidenote. eg:

Arguments:
  font_size - The desired font size in pixels. This will be converted to ems for you. Defaults to 10px.
  base_font_size - The base font size in pixels. Defaults to 12px
  old_line_height - The old line height. Defaults to 1.5 times the base_font_size

Mixin: caps()
--------------
Surround uppercase words and abbreviations with this class.
